										<h1>Group Reflection</h1>

										<h3>Thanh Long Nguyen</h3>
									<p>We have been worked as a team for more than three months now, what I can say is the group worked really well together on completing this assignment 3.  As mentioned, we used Instagram to communicate since the beginning, and I would say it is not the most effective, but it still gets the works done. One surprising thing is that everyone was hugely responsible for their assigned jobs, each person pulled their weight and fairly contribute to the assignment. Somewhat, communication is the most important thing when it comes to group work, from what we have learned from the feedback of the previous assignment, we now implemented a new way to keep up with relatively amount of Github log of activity. From my perspective, the group worked extremely well and we finished the assignment on time without any conflicts or arguments. However, everything has a space of improvement, although this might be the last project I work with these friendly and hard-working people, I would want us to meet face-to-face more often to get to know each other and improve trust which then increases productivity and efficiency rather than just communicate through Internet.</p>

									<p>In our group, everything went well with the Assignment 3, In out tutorial class each one of us got a section from Assignment 3 to do and getting started on it, and also again we made a shared google Drive for the Assignment 3, which we could see the work that have been done and for communication we still had the  Instagram group where we communicating through each other and letting the group know if they are coming to tutorial class or not or if anyone is struggle with the work that has been assigned to them. One Thing that could be improve is that getting our work done from the due and not leaving it to the last minutes. One surprising thing was that everyone contributed towards assignment 3 and no one left the group. One thing that I have learned is that if we work as a group we have more better idea about what we are doing and what needs to be done. My part was to do the Tools and Technologies and Motivationand on GitHub I was editing the team profile with the help on long.</p>

									<p>Assignment 3 was beautifully executed with everyone contributing to the task. Workload was distributed through a random generator with two task to complete for everyone, if any task were hard to operate, group members bonded together in the completion of the task. Communication was excel, other than the the times we see each other in class, a group is made on instagram for discussion. For the times that the members were away, updates and catch ups were notified in the group chat, this allowed everyone to stay in touch, allowed the members who fell behind to catch up and kept on the same page. The work is completed prior to the due time frame with hours to spare for correction. One thing surprising is how well the group bonded together in helping each other struggling in their own parts. I’ve learnt that in groups, ideas can be refined into a more exciting and powerful one with different viewpoints.</p>

									<p>The assignment went pretty good and was finished on time before the submission.The group work went nice and easy without any severe work load on any of the team member. The most surprising thing was that we all were quite clear as to what we individually need to do in order to contribute our parts towards the assignment without much arguments. Communication was never a problem as we made a group on Instagram in order to help each other out along with access to a group document in google drive and a group on github which helped each of us to keep a record on where the assignment has reached and edit certain things which, one feels, needed to be corrected. Github allowed us to track changes made by a group member in the website. I feel that this time, we did involve ourselves with others’ parts as well but it was for the sake of completing the assignment on time.  Also, I wanted people to put up their opinions much more clearly rather than just simply agreeing. Overall, working as a group was completely hassle-free and serene as long  as the work gets distributed among the members who are determined to give their best. In this way, there is not much load of work and the work gets completed effectively as there is diversity of capabilities and brainstorming ideas.</p>
