										<h1>Group Reflection</h1>

										<h3>Thanh Long Nguyen</h3>
									<p>We have been worked as a team for more than three months now, what I can say is the group worked really well together on completing this assignment 3.  As mentioned, we used Instagram to communicate since the beginning, and I would say it is not the most effective, but it still gets the works done. One surprising thing is that everyone was hugely responsible for their assigned jobs, each person pulled their weight and fairly contribute to the assignment. Somewhat, communication is the most important thing when it comes to group work, from what we have learned from the feedback of the previous assignment, we now implemented a new way to keep up with relatively amount of Github log of activity. From my perspective, the group worked extremely well and we finished the assignment on time without any conflicts or arguments. However, everything has a space of improvement, although this might be the last project I work with these friendly and hard-working people, I would want us to meet face-to-face more often to get to know each other and improve trust which then increases productivity and efficiency rather than just communicate through Internet.</p>

									<p>In our group, everything went well with the Assignment 3, In out tutorial class each one of us got a section from Assignment 3 to do and getting started on it, and also again we made a shared google Drive for the Assignment 3, which we could see the work that have been done and for communication we still had the  Instagram group where we communicating through each other and letting the group know if they are coming to tutorial class or not or if anyone is struggle with the work that has been assigned to them. One Thing that could be improve is that getting our work done from the due and not leaving it to the last minutes. One surprising thing was that everyone contributed towards assignment 3 and no one left the group. One thing that I have learned is that if we work as a group we have more better idea about what we are doing and what needs to be done. My part was to do the Tools and Technologies and Motivationand on GitHub I was editing the team profile with the help on long.</p>

									<p>Assignment 3 was beautifully executed with everyone contributing to the task. Workload was distributed through a random generator with two task to complete for everyone, if any task were hard to operate, group members bonded together in the completion of the task. Communication was excel, other than the the times we see each other in class, a group is made on instagram for discussion. For the times that the members were away, updates and catch ups were notified in the group chat, this allowed everyone to stay in touch, allowed the members who fell behind to catch up and kept on the same page. The work is completed prior to the due time frame with hours to spare for correction. One thing surprising is how well the group bonded together in helping each other struggling in their own parts. I’ve learnt that in groups, ideas can be refined into a more exciting and powerful one with different viewpoints.</p>

									<p>The assignment went pretty good and was finished on time before the submission.The group work went nice and easy without any severe work load on any of the team member. The most surprising thing was that we all were quite clear as to what we individually need to do in order to contribute our parts towards the assignment without much arguments. Communication was never a problem as we made a group on Instagram in order to help each other out along with access to a group document in google drive and a group on github which helped each of us to keep a record on where the assignment has reached and edit certain things which, one feels, needed to be corrected. Github allowed us to track changes made by a group member in the website. I feel that this time, we did involve ourselves with others’ parts as well but it was for the sake of completing the assignment on time.  Also, I wanted people to put up their opinions much more clearly rather than just simply agreeing. Overall, working as a group was completely hassle-free and serene as long  as the work gets distributed among the members who are determined to give their best. In this way, there is not much load of work and the work gets completed effectively as there is diversity of capabilities and brainstorming ideas.</p>

									<p>There were no issues in terms of how the group worked during this assignment, much like the previous assignment. All team members worked hard in order to get their sections of the project done, with individuals offering to help each other complete sections they believed they would be able to help with. There was a lot more group collaboration this time around when completing the assignment I believe, which helped to create an application that everyone was passionate about and could discuss if asked questions about. Whilst last assignment we used our instagram chat to ask each other questions, this time around we had much larger discussion regarding the work and how we were going to complete it. Like previously mentioned by the other members, there were some weeks where team members could not attend tutorials due to illness, which made it a little more difficult to have group discussions. However, this did not greatly affect our work, as each member completed their share of the work to a high standard. I have nothing negative to say about this group, as everyone pulled their weight and was understanding of each other if there was some difficulty with completing work or attending classes. In terms of improvement, if this group was to ever to work together again, I hope that we could meet more often in person to collaborate on certain parts of the project where collaboration is needed, in order to get a more universal and concise understanding of our application’s purpose, functions and ultimate goal. As a group, we communicate more through google docs than the GitHub repository, hence why there are not many comments. The repository does not reflect the overall collaboration of the group, nor how effectively we completed our work; as our google documents and changes history are a much more effective demonstration of our team work, and the distribution of work between members.</p>

									<p>Likewise to assignment 2, the Kung Fu Pandas worked really well together again. Although we had a slower start as the jobs needed to be distributed out, we figured we would assign everyone randomly. If anyone had any issues with their work they would message the instagram group chat and discuss with other group members to come to a resolution. Overall the group worked smoothly and there was little to none problems throughout the whole assignment period. Our focus on this assignment was to produce a high quality project report and website, we looked at the feedback from assignment 2 and addressed what we needed to do better for assignment 3, in doing this I believe we have produced a higher quality report than last time. We really expanded our ideas from assignment 2 and have put a lot of time and effort into making sure we covered everything that is required. We had days where people were sick and couldn’t come to class but we still managed fine and everyone completed their work.</p>
