									<p>All the people appointed are required to have team work and time management skills along with skills in their particular expertise.
									<p>Here we will be requiring the following four positions with the skills :</p>
										
										<h3>1) Front End developer:</h3>
									<p>This person will be a professional in developing apps. Front end languages include HTML, CSS, and Javascript. He would be responsible for coding down the app which can run on both android and IOS systems. In a nutshell, Front end developers will be engaged in analyzing code, design, and debugging applications along with ensuring a seamless user experience. A front end developer is responsible for the look, feel and ultimately design of the site. For this, he or she should have knowledge about the UI designs in order to fit the design created by the designer. The developer needs to know how to execute, facilitate and analyze research and data,composition and graphic design and have a knack for palettes, typography and branding in order to make an interface shine and have its own identity. Furthermore, communication and creativity are also some major skills that the developer should possess. This would clarify all the details and aspects of the development phase. Creativity would help a lot as the developer can surely suggest laconic ideas to make the app technically sound as well as intuitive in terms of design. he ability to solve problems as well as empathize with the user to understand what he needs is also important.</p>
								
										<h3>2) Back End Developer:</h3>
									<p>Making updates and changes in addition to monitoring functionality of the site will be the primary responsibility. This type of web development usually consists of three parts: a server, an application, and a database. Code written by back end developers is what communicates the database information to the browser. Anything you can’t see easily with the eye such as databases and servers is the work of a back end developer. Many back end developers know front end languages such as HTML and CSS but need to use languages such as Java, PHP, Ruby on Rails, Python, and .Net.  Back end developers are most focused on a site’s responsiveness and speed. These languages are used to create dynamic sites which are different from static sites in that these types of websites store database information. Communication and collaboration skills are paramount.</p>

									<p>The QA engineer role involves the tasks such as understanding of the software product features & domain knowledge, writing test plans, writing test specifications, manual execution of tests and interpreting results. Later, one has to do the development of automated tests, automated execution and generation of final results summary for release level regression testing. QA engineers can participate in all stages of the software development lifecycle, therefore team work is also necessary along with basic coding skills.
									Overall, the QA Engineer has to undertake all the tasks of performing various tests to ensure the quality of the app so that it satisfies it’s users.</p>
								
										<h3>4) Business Analyst:</h3>
									<p>A business analyst is a communicator. He would be responsible to understand the app from different perspectives - technology side of what can be effectively used to improve  the business as well as gathering requirements and doing a thorough competitive analysis for the app. Business Analysts involved will insure that all IT groups and vendors have the sufficient clarity towards requirements and appropriate detailed requirements are gathered by other groups and will be involved in requirements review. He will be responsible for the marketing strategies for the app along with defining the potential competitors and solutions to overtake them. For this , understanding of various IT aspects such as basic knowledge of programming, data management, a great business sense and problem-solving techniques are essential.To summarize, he will be responsible for overall management of the app to ensure it runs effectively without any major issues.</p>
