										<h2>James Matthew Bird</h2>
									</header>
									<p>James - My name is James Matthew Bird and my student number is s3785646. My RMIT student email is s3785646@student.rmit.edu.au. I have completed VCE and I am a first year University student at RMIT. My nationality is New Zealander, I was born and raised there up until I was 10 which was when I move to Australia. I speak English fluently, I learned some Te Reo Maori when I was in New Zealand but I can only remember a couple of words now, I also completed Units 1 & 2 of Japanese Language in high-school so I have an alright knowledge of Japanese Language. I play Basketball for the U21.2s Pakenham Warriors and enjoy playing every week, I once dreamed of playing professionally but realised my lack of skill. I also like to play League of Legends and have been playing for 3 years now. I have two cats named Levi and Asher, I have had them for about 1 year. In Assignment 2, everything ran very smoothly, everyone understood their part in the assignment and the work was completed efficiently and on-time. We were all complete before the due date giving us a whole day to edit anything that wasn’t satisfactory for our standards. The whole group worked hard, and as a result we were able to produce a high-quality website and report. Therefore we are going to implement the same approach and start working straight away. For the next 2 ½ years I plan to finish my Bachelor’s in Information Technology so I am able to qualify for an entry level IT job. I’m going to Major in cloud computing so that I expand my knowledge of cloud computing and can specialise in it later in life. I am going to see if I can do a short project management course or as an elective so I have experience in managing projects. After completing my Bachelor’s I definitely see completing a Masters degree as an option but whether I study and work at the same time or study first depends on my future situations. After completing my masters and with a couple years experience, I think I will be well on my way to becoming a Cloud Architect. A cloud architect is someone who specialises in analysing a business’ cloud computing strategy through aspects such as design, strategies, management and monitor the cloud system. A cloud architect also manages application architecture and deployment in cloud environments. Compared to others in the group, I am the only one looking to pursue Cloud computing.</p>

												<h3>Thanh Long Nguyen</h3>
											</header>
											<p>My name is Thanh Long Nguyen, call me Long for short. I am 18 years old who currently studies at RMIT University as a freshman in Bachelor of Information Technology with an ID of s3699180. You can contact me through my email address thanhlong2000@gmail.com or through my student email address of which is s3699180@student.rmit.edu.au. A bit about myself, I can speak Vietnamese, English and a little of German. I also loves to experience and try different foods and cuisines, for example, Italian, Chinese, American and explicitly Korean. Additionally, I also adore animals, my family owns a British Shorthair cat back in Vietnam, and there are no words to describe how wonderful he is. Last but not least, I like to play badminton as a sport and also a range of video games like league of legends, Apex legends and Smash. Regarding Assignment 2 group's processes, everyone in the group had worked very hard to achieve the best outcome for the assignment. To function successfully in a group and keep tracks the flow of the assignment works, we created a group chat on Instagram to get to know more about each member which also improve trust in a relationship. Therefore our ability to come to an agreement or consensus on an issue is much easy to be solved. For my experience, I was encountering difficulties in ideas for our website, then my team noticed and helped me a lot by willing to open to new ideas and diverse viewpoints. Moreover, everyone was very responsible since everyone agreed on what needs to be done by whom and they all finished their parts extremely well. In assignment 3, I want every member to keep the spirit up, and maybe discuss the works have to be done as a whole so everyone should be on the right track. After completing the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT, I would like to pursue Software Developer. For more details,  Software Developers are the brains of the entire development process for a software program. Some may mistaken between software developer and programmer. So basically, software developers are in charge of designing the software and identifying the core function based on users' needs and demands, then instruct the programmers to code the software. To help to achieve this job, after finishing Bachelor's, I will try to get an internship from software-oriented companies to gain some experiences. Depend on the situation, whether I hope to be a part of the company that I interned for or head to a master degree in Computer Science.  After then, I think I will be confident with all of those experiences and knowledge to really pursue my ideal job as a Software Developer. In comparison to other group members' ideal jobs, I think my career has some similarities with UX Designer and Website Designer because we're both customer-oriented.
