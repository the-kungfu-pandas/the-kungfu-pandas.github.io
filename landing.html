										<h2>James Matthew Bird</h2>
									</header>
									<p>My name is James Matthew Bird and my student number is s3785646. My RMIT student email is s3785646@student.rmit.edu.au. I have completed VCE and I am a first year University student at RMIT. My nationality is New Zealander, I was born and raised there up until I was 10 which was when I move to Australia. I speak English fluently, I learned some Te Reo Maori when I was in New Zealand but I can only remember a couple of words now, I also completed Units 1 & 2 of Japanese Language in high-school so I have an alright knowledge of Japanese Language. I play Basketball for the U21.2s Pakenham Warriors and enjoy playing every week, I once dreamed of playing professionally but realised my lack of skill. I also like to play League of Legends and have been playing for 3 years now. I have two cats named Levi and Asher, I have had them for about 1 year.</p>
									<p>In Assignment 2, everything ran very smoothly, everyone understood their part in the assignment and the work was completed efficiently and on-time. We were all complete before the due date giving us a whole day to edit anything that wasn’t satisfactory for our standards. The whole group worked hard, and as a result we were able to produce a high-quality website and report. Therefore we are going to implement the same approach and start working straight away.</p>
									<p>For the next 2 ½ years I plan to finish my Bachelor’s in Information Technology so I am able to qualify for an entry level IT job. I’m going to Major in cloud computing so that I expand my knowledge of cloud computing and can specialise in it later in life. I am going to see if I can do a short project management course or as an elective so I have experience in managing projects. After completing my Bachelor’s I definitely see completing a Masters degree as an option but whether I study and work at the same time or study first depends on my future situations. After completing my masters and with a couple years experience, I think I will be well on my way to becoming a Cloud Architect. A cloud architect is someone who specialises in analysing a business’ cloud computing strategy through aspects such as design, strategies, management and monitor the cloud system. A cloud architect also manages application architecture and deployment in cloud environments. Compared to others in the group, I am the only one looking to pursue Cloud computing.</p>

												<h2>Thanh Long Nguyen</h2>
											</header>
											<p>My name is Thanh Long Nguyen, call me Long for short. I am 18 years old who currently studies at RMIT University as a freshman in Bachelor of Information Technology with an ID of s3699180. You can contact me through my email address thanhlong2000@gmail.com or through my student email address of which is s3699180@student.rmit.edu.au.</p>
											<p>A bit about myself, I can speak Vietnamese, English and a little of German. I also loves to experience and try different foods and cuisines, for example, Italian, Chinese, American and explicitly Korean. Additionally, I also adore animals, my family owns a British Shorthair cat back in Vietnam, and there are no words to describe how wonderful he is. Last but not least, I like to play badminton as a sport and also a range of video games like league of legends, Apex legends and Smash.</p>
											<p>Regarding Assignment 2 group's processes, everyone in the group had worked very hard to achieve the best outcome for the assignment. To function successfully in a group and keep tracks the flow of the assignment works, we created a group chat on Instagram to get to know more about each member which also improve trust in a relationship. Therefore our ability to come to an agreement or consensus on an issue is much easy to be solved. For my experience, I was encountering difficulties in ideas for our website, then my team noticed and helped me a lot by willing to open to new ideas and diverse viewpoints. Moreover, everyone was very responsible since everyone agreed on what needs to be done by whom and they all finished their parts extremely well. In assignment 3, I want every member to keep the spirit up, and maybe discuss the works have to be done as a whole so everyone should be on the right track.</p>
											<p>After completing the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT, I would like to pursue Software Developer. For more details,  Software Developers are the brains of the entire development process for a software program. Some may mistaken between software developer and programmer. So basically, software developers are in charge of designing the software and identifying the core function based on users' needs and demands, then instruct the programmers to code the software. To help to achieve this job, after finishing Bachelor's, I will try to get an internship from software-oriented companies to gain some experiences. Depend on the situation, whether I hope to be a part of the company that I interned for or head to a master degree in Computer Science.  After then, I think I will be confident with all of those experiences and knowledge to really pursue my ideal job as a Software Developer. In comparison to other group members' ideal jobs, I think my career has some similarities with UX Designer and Website Designer because we're both customer-oriented.</p>

												<h2>Chloe Henry</h2>
											</header>
											<p>s3791766, Emails: s3791766@student.rmit.edu.au , ahswinters@outlook.com. I am Australian (predominantly English/German in background), My education to date includes Berwick Fields Primary School from 2006-2012, Kambrya College from 2013-2018, and RMIT 2019 - 2021 (hopefully). I am an avid gamer and enjoy watching anime, as well as reading manga in my spare time. I am a part of the RMIT Esports club, and currently the support/mid laner for a team in RMIT’s League of Legends tournament.</p>
											<p>My friends and I often spend our weekends at Karaoke Bars when we want a break from university.  In terms of languages I speak English and basic German, however I'm studying Japanese language as an elective this year. My interest in IT began relatively late into my last year of high-school, due to changing friendship groups I became surrounded with people who had a passion for IT and gaming, which influenced my own passion for IT through constant exposure to it, and a fascination for how the internet, hardware, and software all works together in order to perform certain functions. Before starting Bachelor of Technology, I had little IT experience.</p>
											<p>In terms of our groups’ processes, the group worked exceptionally well together overall, with each member contributing a fair amount of the work to the project. Even if not every member was present for every tutorial, this did not in any way negatively impact the previous assignment, as all work was submitted on time completed to a high standard. The group communicated any questions or concerns well, creating a group chat on Instagram in order to maintain contact with one another whilst completing the project. In terms of changes for the process we use in Assignment 3, I do not think will be changing much, however we may discuss the work more as a whole group rather than completing the parts separately, as this project requires more group discussion and team work than the last.</p>
											<p>My career plan involves pursuing a career in UX design after finishing my Bachelor of Technology (computing studies) at RMIT. A UX designer is in charge of monitoring and collaborating with teams to create the best user experience possible for users of a specific item (software, technology, etc), and is continuously thinking about how the users’ experiences can be improved through the creation of journey maps, wireframes and prototypes.I am more interested in this side of technology compared to programming or engineering, hence why I am planning to become a UX designer, as this involves more creativity and freedom in comparison to a job in programming or engineering, however that is just my opinion. Compared to the ideal jobs presented by the other group members, my ideal job of UX designer is not shared by anyone else in the group, as each member has a different ideal job. The most similar job to UX design is Web design, which involves designing the appearance and layout of websites, however this is where the resemblance in jobs ends. Each member of the group’s ideal job is unique and different from one another, which helps create a variety of ideas within the group; and allows each of us to contribute to the project whilst practicing the skills required for our ideal jobs, without overlapping with another member.</p>

Some of my hobbies include drawing, and playing video games from many categories, and often working out and spending most of my time indulging into the youtube and anime however not a weeb.</p>
											<p>Throughout assignment 2, everything went exceptionally well as everyone completed their part to high standards. The ongoing communication allowed everyone to stay focused and stay on task while simultaneously providing assistance for those who need clarification. We completed the project on time with hours to spare, allowing for the final touches or any change in mind. The assignment is submitted before the due date, overall assignment two went very well for this group and this behaviour continues towards assignment 3, the group will excel.</p>
											<p>After completing my Bachelors of Information Technology, i wish to gain experience in working in the field of IT, working towards the goal of a sales engineer. A sales Engineer focuses on interacting with the company directly itself, this roles focuses on “closing the deals”, showcasing presentation and swaying clients in participating in the company. This job involves a high understanding of cyber security. While working towards my job of a Sales Engineer, i would need to improve many skills including socialisation, presentation and increasing general knowledge of the industry. While the sales engineer job, working in cyber security is unique to all of the members ideal job, it shares the similar aspect of working in IT industry.</p>

												<h2>Ishita Verma</h2>
											</header>
											<p>My name is Ishita Verma and I'm currently studying Bachelors of Information Technology at RMIT university. My student number is 's3757453' and my email address is ishitaverma078@gmail.com. Being an Indian and 18 years in age, I've completed my secondary education from India in year 2018. I'm a Hindu, so I can fluently speak Hindi as well as English.Talking about my interests and hobbies,initially, I love gymming! Gym is like a rejuvenation house for me. I am also a great fan of Badminton. Not everyone knows that i was a badminton player in my school. Apart from these, I have a pet dog whom I love the most and his name is Leo.</p>
											<p>The previous assignment went quite well. We completed our individual parts much earlier than the due date and had sufficient time left for editing the group website.Everyone devoted proper time for researching and completing their parts effectively.Communication was never a problem as we made a group on Instagram in order to help each other out along with access to a group document in google drive and a group on github which helped each of us to keep a record on where the assignment has reached.Our main project idea for the assignment 3 will remain same to that of the previous assignment with some additions and subtractions done, if needed. For this assignment, we all are required to work together onto everything rather than keeping it to our parts. So, there will be more discussions and work needed from each member of the group.</p>
											<p>A business analyst job typically includes creating a detailed business analysis, outlining the problems and opportunities and coming up with a solution in order to benefit the company. Along with a strong sense of business handling and management, information technological skills such as software development and data management are the key requirements for the job. In comparison to the other jobs, my job is kind of similar to the software developer as I will have to create some sort of software in order to solve a particular issue for the company along with data management which is unique to all the other jobs but the one common thing is that we all will be working in the field of IT and making use of our skills in our respective jobs.</p>
