										<h3>Aims</h3>
									<p>The overall aim of this project is to create a fitness application that encompasses all the features and tools necessary to help a user achieve their fitness goal. The application is not just aimed at weight-loss, or fighting the current obesity rates that exist globally, but improving the overall fitness and wellbeing of users. This aim can be achieved through the app’s features, such as providing users with support networks that can assist with the psychological turmoil that can come with attempting to improve oneself, including methods to help cope with stress. Another feature that can help achieve the overall aim of this application is customisation of fitness plan, including inputs of the user’s age, current weight, lifestyle habits, and the goal that THEY aim to achieve through the use of this app (such as weight loss, healthier eating habits, improved sleep, etc). To put it simply, the aim of this application is to help the user achieve their personal fitness goal, and make the user feel better about themselves.</p>
									<p>A goal of this application is to beat other fitness app competitors on the market by providing users with a better user experience, for free as opposed to pay-for features that are included in competitor apps. By including features such as personalised fitness plans, meal and workout suggestions for free use within the app; users will be able to get the most out of the application, without having to pay to unlock them, like (insert competitor app and explanation here). In order to achieve this goal, the application will still need funding to support the features, and this could potentially come through sponsorship deals and advertisements. The application will advertise health food brands, supplements, companies and gyms that pay to be recommended to the application’s users, however only if the brand would genuinely benefit the user and help them to achieve their fitness goal. For example, a user who wants to eat healthier, will be recommended health food brands that pay for advertising within the application. It is important to note that at no point will users be recommended brands and companies that are irrelevant to their fitness journey, simply because they paid to be advertised on the apps. Brands can also put their items for sale within the application, however the app will take a percentage of these sales in order to support the free-to-use features and keep them free.</p>
									<p>Another goal of this application is to give users the motivation to maintain working on their goal until they’ve reached it. I believe a major reason as to why users often delete fitness apps after a few weeks of use is because they lack the motivation to continue working on their goal, whether this be due to laziness, a busy schedule, lack of results or a lack of knowledge on how to continue working on their goal, ultimately a majority of people who download fitness apps end up deleting them, with little to no results to  show for it. This goal of motivating users can be achieved through showing the user their progress on a weekly basis or giving tips on how to go about achieving their fitness goal. The implementation of a free customisable fitness plan may also help to achieve this goal, as many competitor applications require their user to pay for certain advanced features, which may deter the user from continuing to use the application. Hence, by making this application and the majority of its features free-to-use, users are more likely to keep the app, and therefore maintain working on their fitness goal, helping us to achieve the overall aim of our app – helping users to reach their fitness goals.</p>
										
										<h3>Plans and Progress</h3>
									<p>Our assignment project is designed to help fight against obesity and help others create a healthy lifestyle. When researching obesity it discusses how it is a disease based off of having an extreme excess amount of body fat, although this is just the tip of the iceberg. Yes it is the definition although obesity isn’t just excess fat, it breeds from addiction and poor lifestyles. As stigma towards overweight people grows this can promote weight gain by causing sufferers to stay away from public areas due to the fear of being judged.</p>
									<p>This encourages people to stay home trapped between four walls. This really rocks the mental state and can lead to dissatisfaction with life or even worse, depression. This cycle perpetuates obesity making it worse which is why we are creating this app to help those who really need it. Obviously our whole user group isn’t going to be all obese people, but rather most likely a minority. The app would definitely appeal to those looking just to get in shape or simply become more fit. A lot of people these days aren’t happy with their appearance and becoming fitter helps them become more confident and comfortable in their skin leaving them more satisfied and happy which contributes to a healthy lifestyle and healthy living habits. People in today’s society are very lazy meaning they have developed bad habits that are hindering their potential of becoming fit and healthy. Examples of this are things like getting fast food, playing excessive amounts of video games, watching TV for extended periods of time, using a car for walking distance destinations, lack of physical exercise, sleeping late/inadequate sleep. Everyone is different and has different contributing variables to their habits. Another user group would be those who are fit but looking to take that extra step, they train hardcore and really look at the stats, they eat to the gram and count their calories for each meal. We need to make sure we cater for all our user groups necessarily so it is very inclusive because alienating users would reduce user count significantly.</p>
									<p>The application is called Adaptive Health & Fitness, we chose this name because it really represents what we are about, we want our app to be adaptive to every user and we feel as though this name ticks all the boxes as to what we need to represent the app.</p>
									<p>On the first opening of the app the user will be prompted to enter their gender, height, weight and age. They have the option to connect to facebook if they want to so they can compete with/challenge their friends.The challenges are simple, things such as most steps, longest run, most active time, etc. By providing a competitive edge to the app (which is optional) it helps fuel the user’s motivation and complete their goals faster or easier. When signed up the user has multiple activities they can accomplish within the app. Firstly there is exercising plans, based off of the user’s info they will be prompted with recommended workouts and from there they can choose the difficulty. The difficulty mixes around the sets for each individual exercise within the whole workout, the user can also customise how many reps/sets for each exercise they find comfortable. There will be different categories for the workouts such as weight loss, fitness, muscle gain, and leisure, this makes sure the user has a wide range to choose from.</p>
									<p>The user can also choose which muscle groups they want to focus on for the workout. To make things more inclusive you can create your own workouts by using any of the exercises and setting the reps and sets. By allowing the user to be free in their choices it makes them feel as though the app is really created for them and they don’t feel restricted in any way. The workouts themselves will have videos showing the correct forms for each exercise with a verbal explanation giving tips and instructions for maximum benefit.</p>
									<p>Apart from the exercise section there is also a dieting section. When deciding to implement this feature it was easy because dieting and working out go hand in hand when losing weight or building muscle. The significance of finding the balance is immense as it can affect the rate at which you see results. By using the user’s information the app can calculate the recommend the amount of calorie intake that is recommended and also percentage of each food type (proteins, carbohydrates, fats, etc.) as a guide. There are multiple factors that go into this, firstly obviously the user’s gender heavily affects how much you should eat because of the different body constructs of males and females as they have different muscle and fat percentages, but also different fat distributions throughout the body. From there, age is considered because if the user is in their young teens they will be experiencing puberty and will begin to eat substantially more as their body needs it for growth, here height and weight is considered because there is a positive correlation with height and weight, meaning that taller people usually weigh more also meaning they should eat more. The main goals of the diet plans are to provide users with a wide range of options that will sufficiently supply the body with all it’s required vitamins and minerals while also catering to the user’s intended purpose.</p>
									<p>The dieting section will provide popular diets that have been scientifically proven to be beneficial, there will be diets that cater for highly active users and incorporate the factor that the user works out, by adding in post-workout meals and pre-workout preparation meals. There will be diets that help with weight loss by lowering the calories slowly over time but keeping food intake the same by changing around the foods to healthier options over time. In doing this the user has time to adjust and build healthy habits that they can use their whole life. Cheat meals will also be implemented to reduce cravings and encourage the user to really enjoy fatty foods but at a controlled rate. If a person wants some variations in the diet, then there will be another section of all of the healthy foods. To make this dieting part much easier and at convenience, the meals that will be mentioned in the diet plans will also have recipes of how to prepare them. This will not only save the time of the customer as he or she won't have to look out for a recipe somewhere else but will also provide them a sense of surety as to what they are cooking is actually what's mentioned.</p>
									<p>Now for the tracking part of the app. We wanted to create a system that can record your exercise, you simply select what exercise you are doing and hit start. The app records the time passed for you and calculates an estimated amount of calories burnt for the workout. For example if I wanted to record a run I would select running for my exercise and hit start when I was ready, I would complete my run and stop the timer, it will tell me how many calories I have burnt for my run. For exercises such as running or walking we can easily use the GPS system in the phone to get a more accurate representation of the calories burnt. For exercises such as swimming and water walking, obviously we can’t use the phone GPS system to calculate calories burnt so the only factor would be time spent. The tracking system is also closely related to the dieting section of the application as it tracks how much you eat. You simply enter what you ate and how much of it and the tracker can calculate how many calories you have had that day. The tracker also calculates water intake and provides a recommended amount of water intake for everyday which would be roughly around 3 Litres of water (12 cups).</p>
									<p>Our goal right from the start of our project idea was to provide an app for users that helps them workout and eat healthy, an overall health fitness app. As a group we agreed and then decided to add a tracking feature of the app because commonly people don’t actually realise how much food/water they are intaking. There are foods out there that come across as healthy but aren’t at all. The main benefit of the tracking system is water intake, as our bodies heavily rely on water to survive, a lot of us don’t realise we aren’t hydrating our bodies sufficiently to stay in our best shape which can heavily affect our mental and physical performance. Simple things such as drinking water and sleeping properly set up the user to have the opportunity to perform at their best.</p>
									<p>Our only obstacles at this point is our lack in knowledge and skill for mobile development as none of our group members is sufficient enough in programming to actually program the app. We have expertise in design and business, but when it comes to actually creating the app, we physically can’t do it with what we have. What we have right now is an overall plan on how we wan’t the app to function and how we would create it if we could, we have developed our ideas over the past 2 months and refined the project plan enough for it to be a legitimate contender against other fitness apps. An obstacle in our way has been how we will profit from our service, there are things such as micro transactions or a Pro version of the app, but we want our service to be as free as possible, selling statistics and data to organisations or the government could be an option but until we know how legal that is then we can’t do much. Once we are more knowledgeable, we will know. For now we have planned out the whole idea of what we want but we haven’t began any planning, designing or coding towards the product so there are a lot of concepts that can change. Another obstacle we have is funding, as we don’t have enough money to actually pay people to create the app then it would be virtually impossible to make.</p>
									<p>To sum up, obesity comes through unorganized and over eating which will not persist anymore after the introduction of this app. This will eventually decrease the amount of diseases caused by obesity leading further to less deaths due to obesity. This app is for making people aware of their health and every person deserves to be having all the knowledge about staying fit without having to pay much for it. By making it easy for the user to track their daily intakes, start diets at any time, and also be provided with professional tier workouts all calibrated to their needs. With ease of use as a primary focus for our app we hope we can develop an app really easy for the users so they have minimal excuses to stop using our app.</p>
									
										<h3>Role</h3>
									<p>In order to create this app, we would require several skills and for us, being first year students, it will take a lot of time and experience to create a full-fledged professional app as it requires very good programming skills in java and HTML along with data managing and app designing skills. Therefore, we haven’t assigned any roles among ourselves but we would need to employ professionals to help with the app. Prior to mobile application development, we will need a Project Manager or a mobile industry specialist for defining − in detail and precisely − the concept on which our app will be focusing. This is something that we all as a group can do.</p>
									<p>For creating this app in a limited amount of time and as soon as possible, we would require help from experienced programmers for coding the app, software developers for making a model of the app (specifically app developer), graphics designers for the professional design of the app and data managers for managing the entire information related to the app. But we will require to hire people to do these things as we are not skilled enough. Apart from this, this app will also require some fitness and nutrition experts that can provide the diet and exercising plans as none of us is an expert in fitness.</p>
									<p>After the completion of the app, we would require a marketing team that could take care of all the operational tests and errors before launching the app in the market along with launching it and ensuring that the app is being downloaded and used excessively. The app will also require building up a community and generating a big amount of content to spread through the media, social networks and digital media to make the community grow. This will include the group members’ part along with some community specialists for building a community.</p>
										
										<h3>Scopes and Limits</h3>
									<p>As the app is a fitness app which would have various exercising and diet plans according to the goals of the person, our first priority will be towards creating some basic plans for exercises and diet plans along with putting in some recipes of the foods involved. This would include basic exercising techniques for different parts of the body and foods with different focus on the macros. For example, the fat loss plan will include more of cardio and high intensity workouts while the muscle gain or weight gain plan will include more of weight training along with hints of cardio or HIIT. In order to increase the scope of this app with time, more exercise and food variations within a particular plan could be added. This would include various exercises focusing on a particular body part which would give the customer independence to try and choose among them. Similarly, increasing the diet food options will also be very likely in achieving customer satisfaction.</p>
									<p>Moving on the further division of diet plans, that are the supplements, these supplement recommendations could be added with time as these are not our primary concern because we would have to affiliate with some brands and people who could provide deep information about them. Same is the case for the motivation part, where motivational videos could be added time to time for people to stay on their respective plans. In case of tracking, this feature will also be in our priority list as this would keep the record of all the improvements of the customers. This would involve keeping a record of the calories of the foods chosen and calories burnt in doing particular exercises and also track the footsteps along with other activities.</p>
									<p>Overall, every feature on this app could be enhanced with time, but our main priority is to include all the basic things which would earn it a title of a fitness app and make it sufficient enough in terms of features to compete in the fitness market. Many more features such as consulting a fitness professional within the scope of the app and fitness apparel and supplement shopping could be included if the app turns out to be good enough. This could be done on the app itself or by linking it to some websites.</p>
									
										<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
									<p>Various technologies and skills will be required for this task. Initially, computer programming in java or HTML5 in a certain workspace such as eclipse or bracket is the primary requirement so as to create an app for the android system. For an IOS, use of Multi-OS engine will be required. This is an open source technology that allows to create android and IOS apps in Java. This technology provides a stand-alone plug-in that integrates into Android Studio on Windows and/or Apple MacOS development machines.  Along with programming, designing and data managing skills will also help a lot for this app because a proper organization of things is what attracts more public. Software testing skills will also be put in use. As my group have minimal skills in programming and HTML./p>
									<h4>HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS</h4>
									<p>For the app to run, various hardware has also to be used such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, compasses and GPS. Motion trackers are used to measure walking, running, cycling and swimming activities.  With the data collected, smartwatches and apps can calculate speed, cadence, distance travelled, and number of calories burnt. The hardware such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and compasses are already stacked in the smartphones.</p>
									
										<h3>Testing</h3>
									<p>Since we have not come up with a high fidelity prototype, so we don't really have a chance to test our project in real life. But, theoretically, we did develop multiple methods of how would we test our project? And how will we know when our application has succeeded?</p>
									<h4>Survey</h4>
									<p>Firstly, we will design a range of survey questions from demographic to application-related. These types of questions will help us to discover the users' age range, gender, and fitness levels. Therefore, we then know which age group or gender is interested in a fitness app.</p>
									<p><strong>Example survey demographic questions we might ask:</strong></p>
									<ul>
										<li>Select your gender. (male/female)</li>
										<li>How old are you?</li>
										<li>How often do you exercise?</li>
										<li>Do you rather exercise via a fitness app at home or head to the gym?</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Move on the application-related questions; these will be asked to find out what kind of exercise do most of the survey participants want to practice, what are the goals do they want to achieve and importantly is what will motivate them to exercise daily. Therefore, we will able to narrow down which exercise, level and ways of motivation that we should focus on to fulfil our users needs.</p>
									<p><strong>Example survey application-related questions:</strong></p>
									<ul>
										<li>Have you used a fitness app before?</li>
										<li>What is your current fitness level?</li>
										<li>What kind of exercises do you want to practice? (list of exercises to choose)</li>
										<li>What motivates you to exercise?</li>
									</ul>
									<p>How do we find the test users? To answer this question, we will design a survey with mentioned questions above by Google Forms and send the link to our friends and families and ask to keep forward that link after they have finished the survey, so our goal is to publish the survey to reach as many people as we can then our research will be more effective.</p>
									<h4>Observation</h4>
									<p>Testing users through the survey itself may not be reliable. For example, the participants may not provide accurate or honest answers, and they might not feel comfortable to answer the questions because they are afraid to expose themselves to the public. Therefore, to fix this issue, we also come up with another method, which is observation, we as the observers can see for ourselves the accuracy for the observed. So our research would be more reliable.</p>
									<p>We have plans to develop two types of observation approaches; one is opening a private beta testing which we will invite some of our friends and our target audiences (obesity) to come, and each of them will be given our application prototype to have a look and test it. Another approach which is called covert observation, so basically we as a group will spread out, and each will go to a different environment such as a gym, school, swimming pool, and sports club to observe people without their knowledge so we can conduct their real habits and routines.</p>
										
										<h3>Timeframe</h3>
									<p></p>
									<p></p>
									<p></p>
									<p></p>
									
										<h3>Risks</h3>
									<p>Due to having no experience with using software to develop mobile applications, there is a risk that I will use an application software that isn’t best designed for mobile development which will lead to wasted time and money which is not ideal. There also a risk that our design is flawed and doesn’t work as flawlessly as intended, we want the design to be modern and keep the user motivated for more, but if we cannot accomplish that then our app will fail. Another risk could be that the app is designed for multiple platforms at once which could lead to longer processing times, this means the production of the app would be much more expensive to produce. With platform in mind, we also need to look at how smoothly the app runs and if the app is too complicated for users.</p>
									<p>There is always a risk in thinking that your application is perfect and can’t be beaten but sometimes having an app that is complicated and hard to navigate due to extensive amounts of features, it can really affect how the user sees and uses the app. By having a simple purpose, even if the app fails due to complexity, there will still be that purpose that can be relied on, developers can go back to the drawing board and create a new app better than the last. There is always the risk that the staff you hire are not up to par with industry standards and can really delay production causing more expenses and time to be wasted, from a business standpoint, it is a must to employ qualified staff with extensive experience and a trustworthy business background.</p>
								
										<h3>Group Processes and Information</h3>
									<p>Communication is crucial aspect of the project through the 16 week plan and failure to do so can cause massive breakdown within the group. Other than meeting each other in the weekly tutorials group members have agreed to meet up with another within a specific timeframe for the group members to gather and discuss the project and any problems we’ve came to face, the amount of times is based of the individual group members whether they like to meet up and work on the problems together. Meeting up with group members once a week is strongly encouraged,  this will allow us to work together and any conflicting ideas can be discussed at hand.</p>
									<p>There is also a group made on social media called instagram, if any members cannot attend to the face to face meeting, failing to communicate with the team, updates and discussion are will be uploaded in the group chat with all the recent changes so they don't fall behind and can catch up being able to still work efficiently. Any urgent issues and assistances can be enquired in the group chat, this will provide easier way of communication for a lot the members as they instantly become apart of the discussion from the access of  their smartphone and issues can be worked through clearly.</p>
